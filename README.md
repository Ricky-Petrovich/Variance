What is Variance?
--------------

Variance is an experimental new digital currency that enables instant payments to
anyone, anywhere in the world. Variance uses peer-to-peer technology to operate
with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried
out collectively by the network. Variance is also the name of the open source
software which enables the use of this currency

Variance is intended to be an EXPERIMENTAL CHAIN utilizing mainnet for stress tests in both Proof of Work and Proof of Stake simultaneously. Please be wary that this coin may become unstable at any time

For more information, as well as an immediately useable, binary version of
